# A Genetic algorithm for Constant Area Coding (CAC) optimization.

This project is the major task submitted to Dr. Alaa Hamdy as part of the Selected Topics in Data Science Course: Faculty of Engineering ICHEP, Ain Shams University.

In the dynamic field of computer vision, accurate and real-time foreground detection remains critical for applications ranging from surveillance to interactive systems. This project aimed to implement and analyze an adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for foreground masking, as described in the seminal paper by Stauffer and Grimson. The goal was to develop a robust method that dynamically updates the distributions of Gaussian models for each pixel, thereby differentiating between background and foreground movements in real-time RGB video streams.
